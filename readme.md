This repo contains the report of my cryptography course. This report consists of following codes:

1. Frequency Attack (Mono-additive) 
2. Frequency Attack (Multiplicative) 
3. Frequency Attack (Mono Alphabetic substitution) 
4. Hill Cipher 
5. Playfair Cipher 
6. Vigenere Cipher 
7. Extended Euclidian Algorithm 
8. Polynomial Algorithm Implementation 
9. DES Key generation 
10. S-DES Key generation 
11. S-DES Encryption 
12. S-DES Decryption 
13. AES Key generation 
14. S-AES Key generation
15. S-AES Encryption 
16. S-AES Decryption 
17. RSA Key Generation 
18. RSA Encryption 
19. RSA Decryption 



Also a mini project is added which is combination of three algorithms to encrpt the data and also the reverse process is discuessed.
